### Problem Statement

You need to detect and track a high-speed drone measuring 1m x 0.5m, flying towards you at speeds of 50-75 km/h from an initial distance of 2500m. The drone starts at an altitude of 1000m, and you are positioned at a height of 1.5m above ground. The system must calculate the drone's distance from you and its speed in real-time using one or more cameras.

### Solution Approach

#### Hardware Requirements

- **Cameras**:
  - **Stereo Camera Setup**: Two high-resolution cameras spaced apart to capture stereo images, which will allow for depth estimation.
  - **High Frame Rate**: Cameras should support high frame rates (at least 60 FPS) to accurately track the drone's high speed.

- **Computing Hardware**:
  - A powerful GPU-equipped computer (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier or a high-end PC with an NVIDIA GPU) for real-time image processing and deep learning inference.

#### Software Requirements

- **Computer Vision Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
  - PCL (Point Cloud Library): For 3D point cloud processing if using stereo vision.

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch: For running the YOLOv5 object detection model.

- **Tracking Algorithm**:
  - SORT: For predicting and tracking the drone's position based on measurements.

- **Depth Estimation**:
  - Using stereo vision to estimate the distance of the drone from the camera setup.

#### Assumptions

- The environment is relatively open and free from obstructions that could interfere with camera views.
- Lighting conditions are adequate for cameras to capture clear images of the drone.
- The drone is the only significant moving object in the field of view.

#### Challenges/Limitations

- **High Speed of Drone**: Requires high frame rates and processing speeds.
- **Accurate Depth Estimation**: Ensuring precise distance measurements from stereo vision.
- **Real-Time Processing**: High computational load for real-time detection, tracking, and distance calculation.
- **Environmental Factors**: Weather conditions and lighting can affect camera performance.

### Sample Code

Here's the complete implementation, including the SORT tracker:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import torch
from sort import Sort  # SORT tracker
from models.common import DetectMultiBackend  # YOLOv5 model loader
from utils.general import non_max_suppression, scale_coords  # Utility functions for YOLOv5
from utils.torch_utils import select_device  # Device selection for YOLOv5

# Load YOLOv5 model
device = select_device('')
model = DetectMultiBackend('yolov5s.pt', device=device, dnn=False, fp16=False)

# Stereo camera parameters (example values, calibrate your cameras for accuracy)
baseline = 0.2  # distance between the two cameras in meters
focal_length = 700  # focal length in pixels

# Initialize SORT tracker
tracker = Sort()

def detect_and_track_drone(left_image, right_image):
    # Convert images to tensors and batch them
    left_tensor = torch.from_numpy(left_image).permute(2, 0, 1).float() / 255.0
    right_tensor = torch.from_numpy(right_image).permute(2, 0, 1).float() / 255.0
    batch_tensor = torch.stack([left_tensor, right_tensor]).to(device)
    
    # Inference
    with torch.no_grad():
        pred = model(batch_tensor)

    # Apply NMS
    pred = non_max_suppression(pred, 0.25, 0.45, classes=0, agnostic=True)
    
    # Extract bounding boxes from the detections
    if len(pred[0]) == 0 or len(pred[1]) == 0:
        return None, None, None

    # Compute disparity
    disparity = abs(cx_left - cx_right)

    if disparity == 0:
        return None, None, None

    # Calculate depth (z distance)
    depth = (baseline * focal_length) / disparity

    # Calculate (x, y) coordinates
    x = (cx_left * depth) / focal_length
    y = (cy_left * depth) / focal_length

    # Draw bounding boxes and tracker IDs on the frames
    for d in trackers:
        left_id = int(d[4])
        right_id = int(d[4])
        cv2.rectangle(left_image, (int(bbox_left[0]), int(bbox_left[1])), (int(bbox_left[2]), int(bbox_left[3])), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    return [x, y, depth], left_image, right_image  # Return estimated position (x, y, z) and annotated frames

# Main loop
cap_left = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Replace with actual camera indices or paths
cap_right = cv2.VideoCapture(1)

while cap_left.isOpened() and cap_right.isOpened():
    ret_left, frame_left = cap_left.read()
    ret_right = cap_right.read()

    if ret_left and ret_right:
        drone_position, annotated_left, annotated_right = detect_and_track_drone(frame_left, frame_right)
        if drone_position is not None:
            print(f"Drone position: {drone_position}")
        
        # Display the frames with annotations

### Explanation

1. **Camera Initialization:**
   - Two cameras are initialized to capture synchronized frames.

2. **Batching Images:**
   - Convert both the left and right images to tensors and stack them into a batch tensor.

3. **Batched Inference:**
   - Use the YOLOv5 model to perform inference on the batched images simultaneously.

4. **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):**
   - Apply NMS to filter out redundant bounding boxes and retain the best detections.

5. **SORT Tracker:**
   - Use the SORT tracker to track the detected bounding boxes across frames.

6. **Extract Bounding Boxes:**
   - Extract bounding boxes for the drone from the detection results for both the left and right images.

7. **Calculate Center Points and Disparity:**
   - Compute the center points of the bounding boxes and calculate the disparity between them.

8. **Depth Calculation:**
   - Calculate the depth of the drone using the disparity, baseline, and focal length.

9. **Draw Bounding Boxes and Tracker IDs:**
   - Annotate the frames with bounding boxes, tracker IDs, and depth information.

10. **Real-Time Processing:**
    - Capture and process frames continuously, updating the drone's position and speed in real-time while displaying the annotated frames.
